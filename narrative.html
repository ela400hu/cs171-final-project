<p>The court cases we hear about most often involve something extreme, but what is the usual, day-to-day business of the courts?   We have put together a series of interactive views designed to give you a look under the hood of  a large state judicial system you may have heard about,  the Florida courts. </p>
<p>We hope to shed light on questions about the structure of the court system, the volume and type of cases it handles,  and how the cases are resolved. For all of these questions, the answers can vary over time, over geography and over the types of events and resolutions being examined.
  </p>
</p>
<p>This opening view is for exploraton of the data. It gives  an overview of the changes in <a href="#FilingsandDispositions">case filings and dispositions</a> over time, classified by the type of case. Since  population growth and economic activity  are believed to influence court caseloads, the display also shows economic and demographic data for the same timeframe. </p>
<p>This display initially features an animated tour of the different forms of vizualization available for the various data elements; you can select  a single form  and focus on the time path of a specific data item, or in some cases two items displayed together. </p>
<p>The second view is descriptive. It shows how case filings and resolutions can vary over time in different geographic areas.  The  map of Florida  visualizes the structure of the state courts system and permits the user to compare filng data and detailed resolution data.  You can choose to make comparisons at the county level, or to aggregate by circuit (a grouping of counties) or district (a grouping of circuits). Making one  selection compares the selected region to statewide averages, and a second selection compares that region to the first one.  The comparisons of disposition  are further broken down into the type of disposition- whether the case was resolved by jury trial, by pretrial rulings, or by settlement. This does not try to include who won or lost, since that is only meaningful relative to the parties' negotiations which take place privately.</p>
<p>The third view ventures into explanatory and perhaps even predictive use of the data. The hypothesis that case filings are driven by population growth and economic conditions is used  depict a forecast of the changes in caseloads going forward. Of course, since all predictions about the future embody a number of assumptions, the user is given the opportunity to change several assumptions and immediately visualize the result. </p>
