## Design Sketches ##

These initial sketches show a direction for the menu and layout.  Given my understanding of human cognition based design, I chose to feature Scott in the design.  He is the domain specialist and a public figure.  He can provide a design element for triggering and or binding story elements.  Attached are a couple of rough mock ups.

The general color direction is based off of Fathom.  Here are two color grids that can be applied to the vertical layout.  They are made from exact hex values and generated analogous colors.

I also have some font options picked out but I haven't have time to use them yet..

The node based menu is based on this

As well as this general Fathom direction. Text labels and perhaps as appropriate starburst of rotated sliders should be available from the nodes as they are selected.

The background of the yellow viz is based on this:

and is targeted at the big picture comparisons such as budget, aging population trends, and workload trends.

The orange page is meant to point in the direction of

Again, the color values are not exact.  They merely point in the direction of the visual style used by fathom.
